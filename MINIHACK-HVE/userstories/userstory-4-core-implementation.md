# User Story #4: Core Video Generation Implementation

## Goal

Implement the functionality for video generation.

## Constraints

- Must support the chosen technology stack in User Story #1
- Must follow the designed workflow from User Story #2
- Must integrate with Azure OpenAI Sora
- Must integrate with Azure Authentication for API access
- Must include proper error handling
- Don't build the frontend yet, focus on backend and API
- Don't implement authentication or user management at this stage

## Actions

[X] Setup development environment, devcontainer is recommended
[X] Build video generation and file storage functionality
[X] Azure OpenAI Endpoint should be configurable via environment variables
[X] Verify the functionality works as the wireframe design and workflows
[X] Create Swagger doc and serve it at `/api/docs`

## Completion Notes

- Python virtual environment and requirements are set up for local development.
- Video generation and file storage implemented in `app/services/azure_sora.py` and API endpoints.
- Azure OpenAI endpoint and key are configurable via `.env` and `python-dotenv`.
- API matches the workflow and wireframe; integration tests verify functionality.
- Swagger UI is available at `/api/docs`.
