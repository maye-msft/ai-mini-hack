# User Story #1: Technology Stack Architecture Decision Record

## Goal

Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for the technology stack to be used in the web application project.

## Constraints

- Simple backend API using Python, which can talk to AI models and send video data to the frontend
- Simple frontend Single Page Application (SPA) using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3
- Learn the sample code of gen_video.py and use it as a reference for the backend implementation
- No complex video processing features needed initially
- No deployment or hosting requirements at this stage

## Actions

[X] Research and evaluate technology stack options
[X] Create ADR document with options
[X] Ask feedback to choose the best option
[X] Document decision and rationale in ADR

## Completion Notes

- Researched backend and frontend technology options suitable for a simple web app integrating Azure OpenAI Sora.
- Created an ADR (`doc/adr/adr-technology-stack.md`) outlining options and recommendations.
- Chose Python FastAPI for the backend and vanilla JavaScript/HTML5/CSS3 for the frontend, as per user feedback and project constraints.
- Documented the decision and rationale in the ADR and moved it to the `doc/adr` folder.
- User confirmed the technology stack decision on June 24, 2025.
