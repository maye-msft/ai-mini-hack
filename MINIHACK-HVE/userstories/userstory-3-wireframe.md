# User Story #3: Wireframe for Image Generation and Editing Workflow

## Goal

Create wireframes for the image generation and editing workflow to visualize the user experience.

## Constraints

- Should support video generation
- Save wireframe under 'doc/wireframe' directory
- Only focus on the main functionality of video generation

## Actions

[X] Design video generation workflow wireframe in html
[X] Create short and clean documentation for wireframe design

## Completion Notes

- Created `doc/wireframe/video-generation-wireframe.html` with a clean, minimal UI for video generation (prompt, duration, generate button, and video preview placeholder).
- Added a progress bar to the wireframe to show video generation progress.
- Added `doc/wireframe/README.md` documenting the wireframe design and its location.
