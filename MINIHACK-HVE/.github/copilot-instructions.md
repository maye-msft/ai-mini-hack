# Copilot Instructions

Make this project with good folder structure, separation of concerns and tests are important for this project to keep it manageable and maximize any learnings.

The work we'll be doing will be defined as user stories inside the `userstories` folder.

Please read the instructions under the "Goal" section and then proceed through each and every instruction under the "Actions" section. 
Please make sure you check ALL items that need to be marked as checked when completing a story. 
User story looks like the following:

```markdown
# User Story #number, e.g. User Story #1 setup environment (filename: userstory-1-setup-environment.md)

## Goal

input the goal of the user story here, e.g. Create a single-page application (SPA) 

## Constraints

input any constraints here, e.g. Use React for the SPA, use Tailwind CSS for styling, etc.

## Actions

[ ] action to do #1
[ ] action to do #2
```

After completing a user story, please

- check all items that were completed in the Actions section.

```markdown
## Actions

[X] action to do #1
[X] action to do #2
```

## Rules to follow:
- Update the user story mark file about what was done by adding bullets under the "## Completion Notes" section.
- If you don't know how to proceed with a task, please ask.
- I will ask you to create Architecture Decision Records (ADR). When you prepare those, please ask me how to proceed when implementing a user story based on the ADR.
- Please keep everything we do in the context of the project description.
- Use git to commit the changes after completing a user story.
