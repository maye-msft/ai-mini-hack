# Video Generation Wireframe Documentation

This document describes the wireframe design for the main video generation workflow in the application.

## Overview

The wireframe provides a simple, user-friendly interface for generating videos using Azure OpenAI Sora. It focuses on the core functionality:

- **Prompt Input:** Users can describe the video they want to generate.
- **Duration Input:** Users specify the desired video length in seconds.
- **Generate Button:** Triggers the video generation process (disabled in wireframe).
- **Video Preview:** Placeholder area where the generated video will be displayed.

## Design Principles

- Clean and minimal layout for ease of use
- Clear separation of input and output areas
- Responsive and accessible design
