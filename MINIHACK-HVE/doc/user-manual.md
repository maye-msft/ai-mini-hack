## Tips for Better Videos

### Writing Effective Prompts

**Be Descriptive**
- Instead of: "A dog"
- Try: "A fluffy golden retriever puppy playing with a red ball in a green meadow"

**Include Setting and Mood**
- Mention time of day: "morning sunlight", "evening twilight"
- Describe weather: "rainy day", "clear blue sky"
- Set the mood: "peaceful", "energetic", "mysterious"

**Specify Movement and Action**
- "walking slowly", "running quickly", "swaying gently"
- "waves crashing", "leaves falling", "birds flying"

**Good Prompt Examples**
- "A peaceful mountain lake with mist rising from the water at dawn"
- "Children laughing and playing on swings in a colorful playground"
- "A chef preparing pasta in a busy restaurant kitchen"
- "Northern lights dancing across a starry sky over snow-covered trees"

### Video Settings

**Duration Guidelines**
- **Short videos (5-10 seconds)**: Good for simple scenes or quick actions
- **Medium videos (15-30 seconds)**: Perfect for most content
- **Longer videos (45-60 seconds)**: Best for complex scenes with multiple actions

**Resolution Tips**
- **1920x1080 (HD)**: Standard quality, good for most uses
- **1280x720**: Faster generation, smaller file size
- **Custom sizes**: Use for specific needs (social media, presentations)
